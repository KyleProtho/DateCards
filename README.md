## Background
In her essay, Mandy Len Catron explores a study by psychologist Arthur Aron that examines whether intimacy between two strangers can be accelerated by asking a specific series of personal questions. The study presents 36 questions divided into three sets, each set more probing than the last. The goal is to foster closeness by encouraging mutual vulnerability, which is key to developing a close relationship.

The questions range from light-hearted and introductory (e.g., "Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?") to deeply personal (e.g., "If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?").
